Section 6 performance issues:

Add:
performs better with Lists because it doesnt need to check for duplicates before adding.

Contain:
performs better with Hashsets because there are no duplicate elements.
It is also faster to find a specific element because it doesnt need to loop through every single element.

Remove:
performs better with Hashsets. Similar to Contain it can look up a specific element without having to loop through an entire list.
